# TWITTER-SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS

**Project Overview**
 
This project performs sentiment analysis on Twitter data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The primary objective is to build a model capable of classifying tweets as positive, negative, or neutral based on their textual content.

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, refers to the computational process of identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in text to determine the writer's attitude toward a particular topic. It plays a vital role in understanding public opinion, emotional tone, and social trends across large volumes of text data.

**Why Sentiment Analysis?**

Business: Helps companies understand customer opinions, assess marketing impact, and improve products and services.

Politics: Tracks public opinion, reactions to policies, and can aid in predicting election outcomes.

Social Monitoring: Analyzes public mood, detects emerging issues, and supports research and policy-making.

By applying NLP techniques and training a machine learning model on labeled Twitter data, this project demonstrates how sentiment analysis can be leveraged to extract meaningful insights from unstructured social media content.
