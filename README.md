# TWITTER-SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS

**Project Overview**
 
This project performs sentiment analysis on Twitter data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The primary objective is to build a model capable of classifying tweets as positive, negative, or neutral based on their textual content.

**What is Sentiment Analysis**

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, refers to the computational process of identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in text to determine the writer's attitude toward a particular topic. It plays a vital role in understanding public opinion, emotional tone, and social trends across large volumes of text data.

**Why Sentiment Analysis?**

Business: Helps companies understand customer opinions, assess marketing impact, and improve products and services.

Politics: Tracks public opinion, reactions to policies, and can aid in predicting election outcomes.

Social Monitoring: Analyzes public mood, detects emerging issues, and supports research and policy-making.

By applying NLP techniques and training a machine learning model on labeled Twitter data, this project demonstrates how sentiment analysis can be leveraged to extract meaningful insights from unstructured social media content.

**Project Steps**

**1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Began by loading and exploring the dataset, identifying key characteristics and understanding the distribution of features:

The dataset contains 1600000 rows and 6 columns

There are no missing values, but the first row is mistakenly taken as the column heading and also cleaning is to be done in the text column as it contains many stopwords 

The textual data is to be converted into numerical values

**2. Data Cleaning**
